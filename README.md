Side project in Development...

3 systems in test:
- "DayNite" - Day and Night, moves the sun transform on a day night cycle and attempts to match the sun's angle based on season for year round system
- RoadSystem - Contains custom Unity.Editor tool, MB script that attaches to spline gameobject and renders a 3d mesh for roads and intersections
- - Future plans include -- automated sidewalk removal for intersections generated at non endpoint knots on spline
  - PerSpline road data information, right now all splines in container share the same road_width sidewalkWidth etc... would be interesting and more powerful if individual splines could have their own settings
