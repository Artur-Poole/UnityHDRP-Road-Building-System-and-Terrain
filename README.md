Side project in development...

3 systems in test:
- "DayNite" - Day and Night, moves the sun transform on a day night cycle and attempts to match the sun's angle based on season for year round system

- RoadSystem - Contains custom Unity.Editor tool, MB script that attaches to spline gameobject and renders a 3d mesh for roads and intersections
  - Future plans include -- automated sidewalk removal for intersections generated at non endpoint knots on spline
  - PerSpline road data information, right now all splines in container share the same road_width sidewalkWidth etc
  - RigidIntersections for rigid or city like intersections with defined corner placement.  
 
- Procedural Building Generation
  -  In Blender 3D using `Blendify`
